# GraphQL
GraphQL is a data query and manipulation language for APIs that allows a client to specify what data it needs. 
A GraphQL server can fetch data from separate sources for a single client query and present the results in a unified graph. 
It is not tied to any specific database or storage engine.

It tackles the drawbacks of regular REST APIs. With GraphQL, we can pinpoint the exact data we need, 
avoiding the hassles of getting too much or too little. 

It’s all about efficiency and delivering just what’s necessary.

In our Spring Boot project, we’ll harness the power of GraphQL. By combining it with Spring Boot, we’ll create an intuitive and seamless integration. We’ll begin by crafting a GraphQL schema — a masterpiece that defines data types and governs queries and mutations. We’ll use GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) to orchestrate this process.

**Key terms in GraphQL**
<br/>Schema: The schema is the core of GraphQL, an essential blueprint that shapes your API’s structure, defines its data types, and showcases its impressive capabilities. 
<br/>It acts as a friendly agreement between the client and server, laying out which data can be requested and what will be provided in return.
