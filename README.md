# GraphQL
GraphQL is a data query and manipulation language for APIs that allows a client to specify what data it needs. 
A GraphQL server can fetch data from separate sources for a single client query and present the results in a unified graph. 
It is not tied to any specific database or storage engine.

It tackles the drawbacks of regular REST APIs. With GraphQL, we can pinpoint the exact data we need, 
avoiding the hassles of getting too much or too little. 

It’s all about efficiency and delivering just what’s necessary.
